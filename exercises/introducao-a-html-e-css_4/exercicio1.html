        Mantis shrimps, or stomatopods, are carnivorous marine crustaceans of the order Stomatopoda, 
        branching from other members of the class Malacostraca around 340 million years ago.[2] 
        Mantis shrimps typically grow to around 10 cm (3.9 in) in length, while a few can reach up 
        to 38 cm (15 in).[3] The largest mantis shrimp ever caught had a length of 46 cm (18 in); 
        it was caught in the Indian River near Fort Pierce, Florida, in the United States.[4] 
        A mantis shrimp's carapace (the hard, thick shell that covers crustaceans and some other species) 
        covers only the rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. 
        Varieties range in color from shades of brown to vivid colors, with more than 450 species of 
        mantis shrimps being known. They are among the most important predators in many shallow, 
        tropical and subtropical marine habitats. However, despite being common, they are poorly understood, 
        as many species spend most of their lives tucked away in burrows and holes.

        Called "sea locusts" by ancient Assyrians, "prawn killers" in Australia,[6] 
        and now sometimes referred to as "thumb splitters" — because of the animal's ability 
        to inflict painful wounds if handled incautiously[7] — <strong>mantis shrimps have powerful 
        raptorials that are used to attack and kill prey either by spearing, stunning, or dismembering.</strong> 
        Some mantis shrimp species have specialised calcified "clubs" that can strike with great power, 
        while others have sharp forelimbs used to seize the prey (hence the term "mantis" in its 
        common name).

        <h2>Ecology</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Squilla_mantis.jpg/220px-Squilla_mantis.jpg" alt="imagem 3" width="100px">
        Approximately 450 species of mantis shrimps have currently been discovered worldwide; 
        all living species are in the suborder Unipeltata which arose around 193 million years ago.[2][8]
        
        These aggressive and typically solitary sea creatures spend most of their time hiding in rock 
        formations or burrowing intricate passageways in the sea bed. <strong>They rarely exit their homes 
        except to feed and relocate, and can be active during the day, nocturnal, or active primarily 
        at twilight, depending on the species.</strong> Unlike most crustaceans, they sometimes hunt, chase, 
        and kill prey. Although some live in temperate seas, most species live in tropical and 
        subtropical waters in the Indian and Pacific Oceans between eastern Africa and Hawaii.

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <img src="" alt="" width="">
        Mantis shrimp live in burrows where they spend the majority of their time.[9] 
        The two different categories of mantis shrimp – spearing and smashing – favor different 
        locations for burrowing.[9] The spearing species build their habitat in soft sediments and 
        the smashing species make burrows in hard substrata or coral cavities.[9] <strong>These two habitats 
        are crucial for their ecology since they use burrows as sites for retreat and as locations 
        for consuming their prey.</strong>[9] Burrows and coral cavities are also used as sites for mating 
        and for keeping their eggs safe.[9] Stomatopod body size undergoes periodic growth which 
        necessitates finding a new cavity or burrow that will fit the animal's new diameter.[9] 
        Some spearing species can modify their pre-established habitat if the burrow is made of 
        silt or mud, which can be expanded.
